four pillar of oop are------

1.encapsulation
 ->
 its a method to bundle a data within a class that no outsider can access and change that data.
 hence provide a protection or barrier for other classes and method to use my class dsa_ka_bta
->
 but if i want some of my class`s data  accessable to other classes ..i use getter and setter method
->
making property of class private means encapsulating them..


2.abstraction
->
hiding complex things or code behind the procedure to make those codes or things look simple..
->
example-clicking photos just by clicking a button but the actual logic behind that is abstracted means hidden and the procedure looks simple af..

->
we provide abstracted class like contract to user or employe and the class employe was made by engineers with that contract implimentation


3.inheritance
->
supose we have to make a class of human and then a class of female and male
so what we do we will just make a class of human and inherit its properties in male as well as female
class afterall both are human but addition with some more proprties..
like men are muscular,taller
female are flexible,have sharp voice etc.

so here----
human ->parent or base class
female,male->inherited or child class





4.polymorphism
