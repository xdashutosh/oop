four pillar of oop are------

1.encapsulation
 ->
 its a method to bundle a data within a class that no outsider can access and change that data.
 hence provide a protection or barrier for other classes and method to use my class dsa_ka_bta
->
 but if i want some of my class`s data  accessable to other classes ..i use getter and setter method
->
making property of class private means encapsulating them..


2.abstraction
3.inheritance
4.polymorphism
